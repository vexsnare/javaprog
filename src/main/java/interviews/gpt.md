# Food and Diet Planning

Make me a weekly meal plan. I am 32 years old, female with moderate activity levels. I
need 3 meals a day, along with 2 snacks every day. I must hit a protein goal of 80
grams of protein every day, and my calorie limit for each day is 2100 calories. Be as
detailed as possible and include the calorie count and protein count for each meal. I
am a non-vegetarian so ensure that I have varied sources of protein. Ensure that the meals are
oriented towards better cardiovascular health. My current weight is 58kg and height is 5 ft 3 inch and I would like to reduce my belly fat.
